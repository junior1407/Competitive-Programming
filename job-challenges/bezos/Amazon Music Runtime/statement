Pick 2 songs in a way that they end 30 seconds before the duration.

Tie:  Select the pair that contain the longest song.

Keep the original order.


songs durations <= 1001 

Example 1

    duration = 90 (90 - 30, consider 60)
    songs = [1, 10, 25, 25,  35, 60]

    Output
    [2, 4]   (Musics 25 + 35 =  60)
    (2 is chosen instead of 3 because lowest index has higher priority)
